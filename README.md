# A Personal Look Into The CLI Life Of Christopher Grossack (HallaSurvivor)

AKA my dotfiles.

---

After my initial commit in January of 2016, I decided to take these slightly more seriously, so I cleaned out any unnecessary files, as well as anything potentially dangerous to have out in the world, and reuploaded them in March of 2016.

These are certainly a glance into how I think and how I use linux, and I might end up putting some description of what things do here, though I try to keep things fairly well commented in the files themselves.

I hope you find something useful or informative in here :)

## Installation

Even though I love my dotfiles, I strongly feel that people should make their own, so I would discourage you from blindly copying mine, even though I heartily encourage you read it and copy any tidbits you find useful.
In that vein, I have not included a one-command installation file. However, installation instructions are below for those who wish to use them.

Here is the list of symlinks to make:

+ Symlink every file f into ~/.f
+ Exceptions are as follows:
  + redshift.conf goes in .confg
