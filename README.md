# A Personal Look Into The CLI Life Of Christopher Grossack (HallaSurvivor)

AKA my dotfiles.

---

After my initial commit in January of 2016, I decided to take these slightly more seriously, so I cleaned out any unnecessary files, as well as anything potentially dangerous to have out in the world, and reuploaded them in March of 2016.

These are certainly a glance into how I think and how I use linux, and I might end up putting some description of what things do here, though I try to keep things fairly well commented in the files themselves.

## Installation

I firmly believe dotfiles should never be forked or pulled, as they're too personal for that. Although, for the sake of me remembering what goes where...

+ Symlink every file f into ~/.f
+ Exceptions are as follows:
  + redshift.conf goes in .confg
