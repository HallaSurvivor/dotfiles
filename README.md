# A Personal Look Into The CLI Life Of Christopher Grossack (HallaSurvivor)

AKA my dotfiles.

---

I definitely spend too much time playing with these, and this gives me
a way to sync them between computers and keep them under version control.

If you happen to be interested, I highly encourage you to look around! 
I try to keep everything well commented :)

## Installation

I keep two branches active, one for my personal computer, and one
for the andrew machines at CMU. The andrew one is substantially smaller,
but I try to keep them both pretty dependence free.

* Clone wherever you like (intended ~/dotfiles) and change bashrc to 
reflect this.

* symlink appropriately
